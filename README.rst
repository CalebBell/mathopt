After years of using SymPy to optimize expressions, it is time to begin formalizing some of the optimizations I use it for into a library. 
This library will be focused on development work only - i.e. it would never be a dependency of another package. 

Development started 2020-10-10; the library is much too immature for use by others at this point, and may well be for years or forever.
